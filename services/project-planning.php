    <h1>Project Planning</h1>
    <p><strong>True to our name, our only business is Strategics.</strong></p>
    <p>Nevertheless, we realize that program planning, while not strategic planning, are respected disciplines that are appropriate, and often a necessary means of moving initiatives to practical action. However, if not undertaken within a strategic context, they usually result in activities effectively unrelated to the driving purpose of the organization. Multiple programs and projects, without strategic context, become a patchwork of conflicting, competing exercises that dissipate resources and confuse the organization’s identity.</p>
    <br />
<p>In recent years, Cambridge clients have strongly urged that we provide program planning in a strategic context to ensure that there is indeed a holistic system of action, all undergirded by the same strategic philosophy and all dedicated to, and adjudicated by, strategic intent.</p>
<br />
<p>In addition to the specialties described here, we will provide facilitation for unique projects and programs identified by the system that:</p>

 <ul>
 <li class="first">Create strategic intent;</li>
 <li>Expand strategic context; and/or</li>
 <li>Accelerate strategic action.</li>
 </ul>
