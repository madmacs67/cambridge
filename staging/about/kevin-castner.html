Kevin offers expertise in strategic planning and on issues related to the design and functionality of schools. He has assisted Charles County, Md.; Anne Arundel County, Md.; Culpepper County, Va.; the City of Richmond, Va. and the District of Columbia Public Schools with their educational programming to accomplish the strategic intent of each school system's mission and vision.</p><br />
<p>In related efforts, Kevin has provided instructional leadership for numerous school design and renovation projects for three school systems as a building level and central office administrator. As an adjunct instructor for the University of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth University, Kevin has taught instructional leadership courses across Virginia.</p><br />
<p>His experience in working at all levels of public school systems provides him with a deep understanding of the vertical and horizontal challenges and opportunities being explored by PK-16 learning communities today. Connecting with other educators to make sense of needed transitions in our field as we close in on the second decade of the 21st century is a passion.</p><br />
<p>Kevin's 38-years in public education includes 11-years a superintendent in Albemarle County, Va. and eight years as associate/deputy superintendent in Frederick County, Md. During his final years as superintendent in Albemarle County, all schools were fully accredited and met AYP as defined by No Child Left Behind standards; a framework for quality was developed that promotes key lifelong learners using the "Understanding by Design" framework developed by McTighe and Wiggens. During Kevin's years in Maryland, he initiated the Maryland Assessment Consortium involving all Maryland counties, which developed performance assessment test banks that supported the Maryland School Performance curriculum frameworks. During his tenure in both Virginia and Maryland, his leadership role focused on a common vision that ensured actions were directed toward assisting schools in the delivery of instructional programs that supported quality and equity within the school system.</p><br />
<p>Kevin holds a Bachelor of Science degree from Marquette University, Master's degree from the University of Maryland, and a doctorate in Educational Leadership from George Washington University.</p>
