		<h1>David Baldner, M.S. &ndash; Vice President</h1>
		<p class="bodyCopy">David Baldner has been involved in public education since 1982. Beginning in the classroom, David served as a teacher, assistant principal, principal, and as a director of elementary schools in Galena Park ISD located in the Houston area. He then served at a regional level both in the Houston and Lubbock regional centers in the area of leadership and overseeing many programmatic areas in curriculum, instruction, and administration.</p>
		<p class="bodyCopy">Davidâ€™s work with Cambridge began in 2001 as the regional center desired to develop a strategic plan. He became an internal coordinator for the center, and was part of the team that developed and implemented two strategic planning cycles. David has worked with other centers or districts who desired more meaningful strategic plans and strategic plan processes, and his work in the area of quality management and process management have given him a unique perspective state- and nationwide with other education systems.</p>
		<p class="bodyCopy">David became a full associate for Cambridge in 2011 and has moved to Vice President and Senior Associate since joining Cambridge Strategic Services.</p>
